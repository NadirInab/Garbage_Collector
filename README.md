<p >This repository provides in-depth information and resources about the Java Garbage Collector .</p>

<div> <h3> To get a better understanding of deeper concepts, let's do a brief recap, about the following :  </h3> </div>

<div> 
  
- **What is JAVA**
- **What is JDK**
- **What is JRE**
- **What is JVM**

</div>
<div>
  <h2 align="center"> What is JAVA</h2>
  <b>In simple words, Java is a popular programming language that allows developers to create applications that can run on various devices and operating systems.</b>
</div>

</div>
<div >
  <h2 align="center">Java Development Kit (JDK)</h2>
  <b>The JDK is a software package that includes the JRE, Java development tools (compiler, debugger, etc.), and additional tools and libraries needed for Java development.</b>
<h2>Features : </h2>
  
- **Java Compiler (javac) and Interpreter (java)**
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**
- **Java API**
- **Java Debugger (jdb)**
- **Java Archive Tool (jar)**
- **Java Documentation Generator (javadoc)**
- **JavaFX**
- **Version Management**
- **As well as many other features we will learn throughout the year**

  <h2 align="center">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</h2>
  <b>The JVM is a crucial component of the Java platform. It's an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. The JVM translates compiled Java bytecode into native machine code that's specific to the underlying hardware.</b>
<h2>Features : </h2>
  
- **Platform Independence**
- **Just-in-Time Compilation (JIT)**
- **Garbage Collection**

  <h2 align="center">Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</h2>
  
  <b> The JRE includes everything needed to run a Java application or applet. It consists of the JVM, class libraries (APIs), and other supporting files.
    When you want to run a Java application, you need to have the JRE installed on your system </b>

  <h2> In simple terms How JAVA code works </h2>
  
- **Writing Java Code: Developers write Java code using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).**
- **Compilation: The Java source code (.java files) is compiled using a Java compiler (javac), which produces bytecode (.class files).**
- **Execution: The Java bytecode is executed by the JVM (via the java command) on the target system.**
